## Requirement


pyLLE relies on a **python >3.4** front-end for a user friendly interface â€“ either through script commands or GUI - and on a **Julia v1.1.1** back-end for fast computation. Hence, one needs to [download Julia 1.1.1](https://julialang.org)and install Julia first before running the installation of pyLLE. Please keep Julia in the default directory during the installation (i.e. ~\AppData\Local\Julia-1.1.1\). If not, please go to the manual installation.

The different Julia packages required for solving the LLE and interfacing with python will be installed while pyLLE is set up.


## Auto installation


After installing Julia on the machine just run:

```
pip install pyLLE
```

## Manual Installation


Download the .zip [repository](https://github.com/gregmoille/pyLLE/archive/master.zip) or clone it using

```
git clone https://github.com/gregmoille/pyLLE.git
cd pyLLE
python setup.py install
```
Just a heads up, the installation can vary in time, especially because of Julia that might rebuild the cache. If the Julia location is custom, please before running the last line, change in the *setup.py* line 18 to the correct location, as in *pyLLE/_llesolver.py* line **508** to point to the correct location. Thanks

## Python Dependencies

## Checking the Installation

### Checking Python Installation

- Open a python command prompt. You can simply type python in a terminal (Linux/Mac Os) or a cmd window (Windows), or you can launch spyder, jupyter or a ipython instance.
- Inside python, try to import the different package that pyLLE requires to check if they were installed correctly:

```python
import scipy
import plotly
import numpy
import matplotlib
import h5py
import prettytable
import matplotlib
import ipdb
```

If any errors show up due to a missing package please:

- Open a terminal (Linux/MacOs) or cmd window (Windows). **The following commands should not be type in a python instance** but directly in the shell.
- Install the missing package by typing:

```
pip install <missing package name>
```

### Checking Julia Installation

- open a Julia shell
- type the following commands:

```julia
using Pkg

Pkg.add("HDF5")
Pkg.update("HDF5")

Pkg.add("FFTW")
Pkg.update("FFTW")

Pkg.add("LinearAlgebra")
Pkg.update("LinearAlgebra")
```

- You should not have any errors at that level usually.
- If you have an issue with the installation of a Julia package, directly enquire to the faulty pacakge through their github page as they might have solution to install it (the odd that is happens is really small though)
