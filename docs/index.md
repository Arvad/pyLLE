# Welcome to pyLLE documentation

Current version: v2.1


## Team 

pyLLE is a tool to solve the Lugiato Lefever Equations (LLE)1,2,3in a fast and easy way. Thanks to an user-friendly front-end in python and a efficient back end in Julia, solving this problem becomes easy and fast.

Using the efficient computing of Julia, especillay the way fft are implemented makes the overall simulation last only few minutes. On the other hand, python allows a easy scripting, easy display of the figures and easy saving of the results. 

For a fairly complete example, please refer to the [example](https://gregmoille.github.io/pyLLE/Example.html) of  which investigate the soliton generation in a micro-ring resonator

If you are happy with the sofware, feel free to check out our [paper]() on this package, and [cite us](https://gregmoille.github.io/pyLLE/HowToCite.html) when you publish. 

If you are not happy with the package (no worry, it happens), please [refer](https://github.com/gregmoille/pyLLE/issues) any bugs or inquiries to improve the package!
