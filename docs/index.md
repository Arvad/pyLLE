# Welcome to pyLLE documentation

_Current version: v2.1_


pyLLE is a tool to solve the Lugiato Lefever Equations (LLE) in a fast and easy way. Thanks to an user-friendly front-end in python and a efficient back end in Julia, solving this problem becomes easy and fast.

Using the efficient computing of Julia, especially the way fft are implemented makes the overall simulation last only few minutes. On the other hand, python allows a easy scripting, easy display of the figures and easy saving of the results. 

How faster pyLLE is compared to other implementation? Well, this quick benchmark speaks for itself: <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>



For a fairly complete example, please refer to the [example](https://gregmoille.github.io/pyLLE/Example.html) of  which investigate the soliton generation in a micro-ring resonator
